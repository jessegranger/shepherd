Logging per block of servers
	- so the API would log to one file, the admin to another, the workers to another.
	- done in the JSON

Logging prefix specified in the JSON
	- so "[server:8001]" or "[worker:8001]" is just the default
	- "prefix": "admin" would produce "[admin:8005]" in the log file.

Uptime, per-process, and global.

Someday: git status, per each exec-y thing.
	- for everything with a "cd": key, do "cd ... && git status"
