x support more than one server type to be launched
x	- and that the pools don't overlap ports

x support count < 0 (means count: -3 means numCpu - 3)
x - "exec": { ..., "count": -1 }

x support a custom nginx upstream name per pool (currently hard coded to "shepherd_pool")
x - "nginx": { "upstream": "shepherd_pool" }

x support custom "server" lines within the pool definition (via handlebars)
x		- server {{server}} max_fails=2 foo=bar;
x   - done by allowing a whole template in HJSON format
x		- nginx: { template: ''' ... ''' }

x (optional) pull all the webRoute stuff out so it supports multiple Herds
x		- new Herd instances would register somewhere global

Don't use Unix signals for stop/restart/reload
	- use REST endpoints
