support more than one -f (start more than one Herd instance)
	- make an explicit check that they don't clash on admin port
	- and that the pools don't overlap ports
support count < 0 (means count: -3 means numCpu - 3)
	- "exec": { ..., "count": -1 }
support a custom nginx upstream name per pool (currently hardcoded to "shepherd_pool")
	- "nginx": { "upstream": "shepherd_pool" }
support custom "server" lines within the pool definition (via handlebars)
	- server {{server}} max_fails=2 foo=bar;

(optional) pull all the webRoute stuff out so it supports multiple Herds
	- new Herd instances would register somewhere global
